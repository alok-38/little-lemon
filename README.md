# Little Lemon

Little Lemon is an  existing project to be examined by us but I decided to take it to the next level by creating one from scratch.

## Installation

This project was bootstrapped with [vite](https://vitejs.dev/guide/).

```bash
npm create vite@latest
```

## Usage

```bash

# get into the directory
cd my-project

# install dependancy
npm install

# run the dev server
npm run dev

```
