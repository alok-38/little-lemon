# Little Lemon

This is the first HTML and CSS project in the [Meta Introduction to Front-End Development Specialisation on Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/learn/introduction-to-front-end-development/programming/omNSR/creating-an-html-document).

Students are required to just examine this project to familiarize themselves with various HTML tags, but I decided to take to the next level by creating a project from scratch!

## Installation

This project was bootstrapped with [vite](https://vitejs.dev/guide/).

```bash
npm create vite@latest
```

## Usage

```bash

# get into the directory
cd my-project

# install dependancy
npm install

# run the dev server
npm run dev

```
